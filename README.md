## Objectives

The objective of this project is to understand how IP addressing, routing, and TCP/IP addressing work by solving real-world networking problems.

## Mandatory Part

You will configure small networks by solving **10 exercises**.  
These exercises are available in a web-based interface where you can:  
- Test your configurations.  
- Verify their correctness using the **Check again** button.  
- Export your configurations with **Get my config**.  

Each level presents a broken network diagram with a goal to achieve. You need to modify the settings to make the network functional.

- No external tools are allowed during the evaluation (except for a calculator like `bc`).
- Each completed level must be exported and saved in your Git repository.

## Submission and Evaluation

- You must submit **10 files**, one per level, in your Git repository.  
- During the defense, you will need to validate **3 random levels** within a limited time.  
- Your work will be evaluated based solely on the files present in your repository.

## Disclamer
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ This project has an educational purpose and you should under no circumstances copy and paste. Cheat is bad. Dont cheat

- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Ce projet a un but educatif et vous ne devez en auccun cas faire du copier coller. Tricher c'est mal. Ne trichez pas
